## Conclusion & Recommendations

Based on the findings, sales increased by 51.56% between 2011-2014, with the highest grossing items being cellphones 
and chairs. According the results, consumer and corporate are the best performing segments with the home office segment 
coming in last. Results also show that top 5 selling sub-categories account for over 50% of the gross revenue, with
California & New York accounting for around 33.46% of the total gross revenue alone. In conclusion, with regards to sales
and marketing, emphasis should be put on the top 5 performing states with the emphasis of the brick and mortar omnichannel 
on California, New York, and Texas. In addition, the top 10 selling items should be a priority with regards to inventory
control. Furthermore, marketing campaigns and promotions should be emphasized towards the end of the year as the sales 
reach the peak during Q3 & Q4 as shown on the data visualization, followed by a hard decline.
